<p id="description"> This project is an AI-powered chatbot I built to offer emotional support and practical guidance to individuals facing mental health challenges. What makes it even more impactful is its multilingual capability—thanks to built-in language translation, it breaks language barriers and makes mental health support more accessible across communities.
Beyond just being a supportive conversational agent, the chatbot’s ability to understand and respond in multiple languages makes it a strong tool across domains like healthcare, commerce, governance, and more—basically, any area where effective and inclusive communication matters.
